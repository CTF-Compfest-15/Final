  Because NeoZap is a true sigma, he developed an HTTP webserver in C to authenticate himself. NeoZap, unlike other noob C developers, knows how to secure his apps from trivial exploitation, like buffer overflows, etc. Prove him wrong!

  Note:
  - Bruteforcing the remote server is not allowed.
  - Length difference between the original binary file and your patch cannot exceed 32 bytes.
